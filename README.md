# ToDo Board

In this application, I build a Todo board using PHP Laravel, InertiaJS, Vue.Draggable, and Taliwind css.

5. Open your .env file and change the database fields correspond to your configuration.
6. Run php artisan key:generate
7. Run php artisan migrate
8. Run php artisan db:seed
9. Run npm install 
10. Run npm run dev 
11. Visit the application in the browser
